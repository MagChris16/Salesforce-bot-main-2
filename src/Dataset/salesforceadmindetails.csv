"The Salesforce administrator—or “admin” is a Salesforce user with system
  administration duties and other super powers. Admins are responsible for setting up Salesforce for
  their organizations and making sure it runs smoothly."
"Admins have special permissions. For example, they can add user accounts and specify what
   people can see and do in Salesforce. Admins can create custom Salesforce objects, workflows,
   validation rules, reports, and more. Admins can manage user profile information and delete
   Chatter feed updates, including posts and comments. Admins are planners, problem-solvers, and
   heroes. All Salesforce organizations have at least one administrator. Your administrator’s
   role can be as simple or as complex as your company’s size and structure. In smaller
   organizations, the admin is often someone who also uses Salesforce the way other users do: to
   sell products or provide customer service, for example."
"Salesforce offers lots of features and items that you can set up and configure yourself. For
   some things, though, partner with your trusty admin to help you get the best of what Salesforce
   has to offer."
"Here are a few examples of the kinds of things your admin can help you with or do for you."
"Find or use an object, field, or feature you heard about during training."
"How you contact your administrator, and when and why, depends on your company’s internal
      business policies and practices."
