        Salesforce, it helps to know how your org is created and the types of licenses, permissions,

        users can do saves you time.","","","","","","",""
"When your order is activated, our provisioning process creates a license request. The
            license request includes definitions that build out your org. These definitions consist
            of settings that indicate which licenses, permissions, and profiles you receive. It’s
            these basic elements that shape the org that you use and what users can do in it.","","","","","","",""
